License for OpenGenSet Hardware Designs

This hardware may be reproduced for personal and internal business use up to 20 units, but may not sold. Any entity wanting to produce for profit must contact us to work out a license agreement.

Order sharing of up to 20 units is permitted - we recognize that a small group of individuals may want to get together to place an order for a number of units to improve cost effectiveness. While one individual would be placing the order and receiving funds from the other, as long as the cost is spread evenly among the participants based on the number of units each is getting this is not viewed as selling regardless of the method.
