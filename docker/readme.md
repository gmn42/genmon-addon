# Docker!
## No support provided for virtualization
Virtualized setups are intended for advanced users that already know what they are doing with the technologies or feel they can figure it out on their own.  Support will NOT be provided for docker or genmon in a docker, these will be files that "work on my machine".

These docker files are working (as of March 2023), however future changes are likely. Persistent volumes allowing config and logs to persist across rebuilds is one likely change. We have no clue if there are other problems, we are using an Ubuntu VM as our primary GenMon environment.

## Build & run
`docker-compose up -d`

## Contributions welcome
I welcome anyone contributing to the cause.
